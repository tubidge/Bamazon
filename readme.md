## Bamazon Market

Bamazon is a simple command line interface app that allows users to place orders for products held in an inventory database. Step by step instructions along with a GIF demo can be found below.

* If you want to use this application, you will need to `npm install` the necessary node packages.

1. Upon running bamazonCustomer.js, you will be shown the current Bamazon inventory. You will also be prompted to type the ID of the item you would like to order.

2. Once you have selected an item, you will be asked how many you want to order.

3. Next, you will see an order confirmation including the total cost. You can choose to proceed, or cancel the order.

4. After this selection, you will be asked if you want to make another order.

5. If YES, you will be started from the beginning. If NO, you will exit the application.
